        <h2>Case Studies</h2>
        <p>E-commerce platforms are booming, providing new brands ample opportunity to establish market presence. In India, top-tier platforms include Amazon.in and Flipkart.com, with others like eBay and Alibaba also contributing. Amazon, in particular, is a household name for online shopping, offering a wide range of products from toys to furniture. With around 300 million active users daily and over 2,000 products sold every minute, new businesses are keen to join these platforms to reach a broad audience.</p>
        <p>A significant revenue source for these platforms is their advertisement panels, offering various ad options like specific keywords, categories, or products. Establishing a brand on e-commerce platforms requires considerable effort and strategic advertising.</p>
        <p>Following the COVID-19 pandemic, online sales surged by 29%, growing from US$79 billion to US$102 billion. I have helped several businesses adapt to this change, enhancing their online presence and increasing their sales through strategic use of e-commerce platforms and advertising.</p>
